"""Append-only Merkle tree with inclusion and consistency proofs.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The evidence log was originally a hash chain:
L_t = H(L_{t-1} || H(snapshot_t) || verdict_t). A chain is enough to detect
alteration and gaps, but only if you replay it. To convince yourself that one
particular record is in a history of n records, you have to fetch and rehash
all n. For an auditor who cares about a single action out of a billion, that is
the whole log.

A Merkle tree gives the same guarantees with proofs logarithmic in n. RFC 6962
(Certificate Transparency) already specifies exactly this structure, and the
specification cites CT throughout, so this is adoption rather than invention.

Two proof types, and they answer different questions:

  INCLUSION    "record i, which I have, is in the tree whose root you
               published." Size ceil(log2 n) hashes.

  CONSISTENCY  "the tree of size n you show me today is an append-only
               extension of the tree of size m you published before -- nothing
               was rewritten or removed." Also O(log n).

Consistency is the one that matters for the truncation and equivocation
attacks. Comparing bare anchor roots tells a verifier that two roots differ; a
consistency proof tells it which of the two histories is not an extension of
the other, without downloading either.

Hashing follows RFC 6962 section 2:
    MTH({})       = SHA-256()
    leaf hash     = SHA-256(0x00 || record)
    interior node = SHA-256(0x01 || left || right)
The domain-separating prefixes are what stop a leaf being passed off as an
interior node (the second-preimage attack on naive Merkle trees).
